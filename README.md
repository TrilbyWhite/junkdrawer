# JUNKDRAWER

This is a holding place for small projects not really worth their own
repository, or for tools that I regularly use, but haven't polished for
distribution (eg, no man pages, simple short-cut makefiles).

- Juke: a music player with "jukebox" interface
- Rolo: an abook replacement
- Catdocx: read docx files in a terminal with no dependence on office
  tools
- Todo: a calendar scheduling tool to interface with `remind` file and a
  plain text todo list
